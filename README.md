DESCRIPTION:
LearnEasy - E-Learning Platform UI

LearnEasy is a lightweight, responsive, and intuitive e-learning platform UI designed for modern learners. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a seamless interface for users to explore, engage, and learn through featured courses. The design emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and ease of navigation, making it ideal for students, educators, and developers looking to build or contribute to an educational web interface.

üîç Core Features
1. Modern Responsive Design
LearnEasy is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring compatibility across devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The clean layout, elegant typography, and adaptive grid structure provide a visually appealing experience without compromising functionality.

2. Featured Courses Section
The homepage (index.html) showcases featured courses such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Each course card includes an image, title, and brief description. When clicked, the card opens a detailed modal popup offering more in-depth information like course objectives, duration, and prerequisites.

3. Interactive Modal Popups
Using JavaScript, modal windows display detailed information about selected courses without navigating away from the page. This helps keep users engaged and provides a dynamic experience that mimics the behavior of modern educational platforms.

4. Course Pages
The platform includes several dedicated pages:

courses.html: Displays a full list of available courses in a neatly arranged grid or list format.

course-details.html: A template for displaying more comprehensive course content, which can be reused for multiple courses.

progress.html: A placeholder for tracking user learning progress‚Äîperfect for future integration with backend systems.

login.html: A simple login and registration form to manage user access and personalization (can be connected to a backend in future development).

LearnEasy provides a solid foundation for any e-learning web project. With its clean UI, interactive components, and modular structure, it‚Äôs easy to expand and tailor it to specific educational needs. Whether you're a beginner learning to build web apps or an educator looking to digitize course content, LearnEasy offers a flexible and engaging starting point.
